Question: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

1- Ask the user to input two numbers: n1 and n2
2- Ask the user to input an operator (+,-,*,/,%): oper
3- IF oper is '+', THEN print n1 + n2
4- IF oper is '-', THEN print n1 - n2
5- IF oper is '*', THEN print n1 * n2
6- IF oper is '/', THEN print n1 / n2
7- IF oper is '%', THEN print n1 % n2
8- ELSE print "<!> INVALID OPERATOR <!>"
9- End
