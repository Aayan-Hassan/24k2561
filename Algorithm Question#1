Question: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
          If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1- Ask the user to enter the number: n
2- Ask the user to enter the divisor: d
3- If (n % d) is 0, THEN print "{d} is a divisor of {n}" 
4- If Step-3 was true AND IF (n % 2) is 0,THEN print "{n} is an EVEN number"
4- If Step-3 was true AND IF (n % 2) is NOT 0,THEN print "{n} is an ODD number"
5- If Step-2 was false, THEN print "{d} is not a divisor of {n}"
6- End
